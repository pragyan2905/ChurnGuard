# 💼 ChurnGuard – ANN-Based Customer Churn Prediction

ChurnGuard is a machine learning web application that leverages an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn. Built using **Python**, **TensorFlow/Keras**, and deployed with **Streamlit**, this project empowers businesses to identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to retain them.
